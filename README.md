# What is BlackLab?

[BlackLab](http://inl.github.io/BlackLab/) is a corpus retrieval engine built on top of [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/). It allows fast, complex searches with accurate hit highlighting on large, tagged and annotated, bodies of text. It was developed at the Institute of Dutch Lexicology (INL) to provide a fast and feature-rich search
interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora.

We're also working on BlackLab Server, a web service interface to BlackLab, so you can access it from any programming language. BlackLab Server is included in the repository as well.
